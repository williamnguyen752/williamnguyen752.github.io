# Resume

Welcome to my resume!
It consists of two parts.
The first part is the free-form narrative of what I do work-wise.
The second part is a more traditional list of companies, positions, and projects.
The resume is available as [.html][resume.html] and [.pdf][resume.pdf].

## Narrative

I am a software systems engineer with a strong foundation in building resilient, scalable applications. I'm passionate about clean, maintainable code and designing systems that solve real-world problems. My experience spans from serverless AWS architectures to cross-platform mobile development, always with a focus on engineering excellence.

I enjoy the challenge of working in multidisciplinary teams, collaborating with experts across different domains to create cohesive solutions. At Convergence Medical, I've had the opportunity to work with medical, mechanical, and electrical engineers to build healthcare platforms that meet high engineering standards while maintaining usability for clinical staff.

I'm particularly interested in systems that can handle real-world constraints gracefully. My work on offline-first capabilities with conflict resolution for clinical environments has taught me the importance of designing for reliability in less-than-ideal conditions. When connectivity is lost in an operating theater, the system needs to continue functioning flawlessly.

Security and compliance are foundational to my approach, especially when working with sensitive healthcare data. I've implemented HIPAA-compliant authentication systems and integrated healthcare standards like FHIR/HL7 to ensure interoperability with existing hospital systems.

Throughout my career, I've maintained a commitment to quality through comprehensive testing strategies. I believe that reliable systems are built on a foundation of thorough unit, integration, and load tests that prevent regressions and ensure performance under stress.

I continue to learn and grow with each project, and I'm excited about the possibilities that lie at the intersection of technology and healthcare.
